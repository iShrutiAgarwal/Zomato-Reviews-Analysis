# Zomato-Reviews-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Zomato restaurant reviews to understand the performance of various restaurants and their reviews using Python.
It was implemented on Google Colab and uploaded here as a part of my Data Analysis project.

## ![logo] About Dataset
Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities.

This dataset containing information of food restraunts in banglaore who are working with Zomato.The data was scraped from Zomato in two phase. 
I extracted this Zomato dataset from Kaggle and after going through its structure I found:

- For each neighborhood there are 6-7 category of restaurants viz. Buffet, Cafes, Delivery, Desserts, Dine-out, Drinks & nightlife, Pubs and bars. 
- So, here we are trying to find the best restaurants for customer depending on their needs.
